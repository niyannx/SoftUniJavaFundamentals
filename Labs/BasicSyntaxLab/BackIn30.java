Every time John tries to pay his bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: &quot;I will be back in 30 minutes&quot;. One day John
was sick of waiting and decided he needs a program, which prints the time after 30 minutes. That way he wonâ€™t
have to wait on the desk and come at the appropriate time. He gave the assignment to you, so you have to do it.
